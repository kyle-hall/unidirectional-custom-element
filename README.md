### My Custom Element

This is a generic Custom Element (web components! yeah!) that does very, very little.
You can click on it, and see the selected attribute change from true to false and back
again, ad nauseam. The cool thing about this element is it uses unidirectional data
flow, a completely new concept to me. This element is based on code written by
Rob Dodson of Google in his talk from Polymer Summit 2016 as well as a blog post
of his. I have added links to both below.

[The Blog Article](robdodson.me/interoperable-custom-elements/)

Trust me, watch that whole video. It's great because there's a lot of information
about custom elements based on the spec, how to create them using unidirectional
data flow, and how Polymer 2.0 can make creating custom elements much easier.

The article reiterates a lot of the information and opinions Rob Dodson talks
about in the video.
